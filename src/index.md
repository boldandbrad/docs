Hi ðŸ‘‹, my name is **boldandbrad** and this is my personal documentation site. I've
made it open source to serve as an example for others.

My goal is to regularly update this site as I discover better tools and
techniques. Since I *am* always trying to learn, feel free to
[submit an issue](https://github.com/boldandbrad/docs/issues) or a pull request
if you have something cool to share with me. However, please understand that I
may choose to reject them.

## Principles

I believe in the [beginner mindset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoshin). To
that end, I do not claim to be an expert in any of the topics covered on this
site and I recognize that there may be several great solutions to any given
problem. Rather than aiming for perfect guidance, I prioritize documenting
concepts that I often find myself searching for. In addition, my goal is to
ensure that the documentation I produce is compatible with the following
principles:

- Be **simple**.
- Be **consistent**.
- Be **inclusive**.
- Explain **why**.

## Patterns

Just a list of things I care about for now...

- Readme Driven Development (RDD)
- Semantic Versioning (SemVer)
- Keep a Changelog
- Agile Principles
- Open Source
- Environmentally concious solutions

## Stack

At the rate that new frameworks, technologies, and design patterns are created,
it is impossible and also nonsensical to maintain a static tech stack. However,
in an effort to create some semblance of consistency and to prevent endless
context switching, I do tend to fallback on a common set of technologies for
projects that I maintain.

Generally speaking, I try to strike a balance between using the best tool for
the job, and using multi-purpose tools. That is, if the best tool for a
particular use case doesn't play well with the rest of my stack/knowledge base,
but the 2nd or 3rd best tool does, I opt for one of those.

For this reason, you'll find that I try to choose tools and patterns that are
applicable in multiple domains.

### Preferred Languages

I tend to prefer working in compiled languages with strong type safety.

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) - A type-safe, memory safe, and performant
  general purpose language.
- [Go](https://go.dev/) - A type-safe, concurrency friendly language with a
  strong standard library.
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - A type-safe superset of
  JavaScript.

### Tooling

- GitHub
- Git - Version control
- Neovim - Text editor
- Vscodium - Text editor
