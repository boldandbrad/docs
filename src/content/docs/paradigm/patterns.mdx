Just a list of things I care about for now...

### Project-Local Dev Tooling

Reduce developer friction by not relying on globally installed dev tooling.

#### Nodejs

Install development tool binaries locally with `pnpm install -D TOOL` (ie: `@vue/cli`, `just-install`, etc) and then
provide a script or `.envrc` file to source `./node_modules/.bin/`.

This ensures that all developers can just `pnpm install` and `source .envrc` to
to have the same tooling and versions available. Developers can still have
global tools installed without worrying about versioning conflicts or tool
management.
