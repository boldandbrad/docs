:::tip[Hurray!]
Docs about the docs!
:::

My name is **boldandbrad** and <u>this</u> is my personal technical documentation site.
I have made it open source to serve as an example for others. I do not claim
to be an expert on any of the covered topics, nor do I always follow industry
best practices. **Use this knowledge base at your own risk**.

My goal is that at the very least you'll find the knowledge contained here to
be compatible with the following principles:

- Be **consistent**.
- Be **inclusive**.
- Be **simple**.
- Embrace **open source**.

With that said, I regularly update the site as I discover better tools and
techniques. Since I _am_ always trying to learn, please feel free to [create
issues](https://github.com/boldandbrad/docs/issues) or submit PRs if you have
something cool to share with me. However, please understand that I may choose
to reject them. If so, please fork and make adjustments for your own purposes
if you wish.

Cheers,

boldandbrad
