title: Minecraft - Server
description: Minecraft Server side setup and mods.
---

This document walks through installing and running a dedicated Minecraft Java
Edition Server on an Ubuntu Server host. I prefer Ubuntu Server as host because
it is lightweight and also not windows.

The modding toolchain and server launcher used in this tutorial is [QuiltMC](https://quiltmc.org/en/).
Quilt provides an installer that makes setup and maintenance simpler, while
offering compatibility with Fabric API mods.

:::caution
QuiltMC is still in beta. Though I have not run into any compatibility or
stability issues with the [mods](#useful-mods) I use, it may not yet work as
expected in ALL use cases.

## Install

Install Minecraft Java Edition Server on an Ubuntu Server host.

### Prerequisites

This guide assumes you've already completed the following:

- [Ubuntu Server Setup](/docs/envs/ubuntu-server/setup)
  - [Enable Firewall](/docs/envs/ubuntu-server/guides/#firewall)
  - [Enable SSH](/docs/envs/ubuntu-server/guides/#enable-ssh)
  - [Enable SFTP](/docs/envs/ubuntu-server/guides/#enable-sftp) (Optional)
  - [Set Static IP](/docs/envs/ubuntu-server/guides/#set-static-ip)

### Create User

1. Create `minecraft` user:

   ```bash
   sudo adduser --system --home /srv/minecraft-server
   sudo addgroup --system minecraft
   sudo adduser minecraft minecraft
   ```

### Install Server

1. Install java:

   ```bash
   sudo apt install openjdk-18-jre-headless
   ```

1. Download the latest QuiltMC Installer:

   ```bash
   wget https://maven.quiltmc.org/repository/release/org/quiltmc/quilt-installer/latest/quilt-installer-latest.jar
   ```

1. Use QuiltMC Installer to install a minecraft server jar:

   ```bash
   java -jar quilt-installer-latest.jar install server MINECRAFT_VERSION --download-server
   ```

   > Note: QuiltMC installs the server into `./server`

1. Run the installed server launch jar:

   ```bash
   java -jar quilt-server-launch.jar --nogui
   ```

   > Note: The server _will_ fail to start, asking you to accept the EULA.

1. Change `eula=false` to `eula=true` in `eula.txt` to accept the EULA:

   ```bash
   vi eula.txt
   ```

### Create system service

1. Create systemd unit file at `/lib/systemd/system/minecraft.service`:

   ```systemd
   [Unit]
   WorkingDirectory=/srv/minecraft-server/server
   User=minecraft
   Group=minecraft
   Restart=on-failure
   RestartSec=20 5
   ExecStart=/usr/bin/java -Xms12G -Xmx12G -jar quilt-server-launch.jar --nogui

   [Install]
   WantedBy=multi-user.target
   ```

   > Note: This guide assumes a dedicated host machine with 16GB of RAM. Adjust
   > the `-Xms` and `-Xmx` values accordingly based on your system's resources.

1. Reload systemctl daemon:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl daemon-reload
   ```

1. Enable system service:

   ```bash
   systemctl enable minecraft
   ```

### Allow through firewall

```bash
sudo ufw allow 25565
```

### Setup Port forwarding

In order for the minecraft server to be accessible beyond the local network, the
service must be forwarded to a port externally. This is typically handled in your
router settings, which differ greatly depending on brand and model.

> Generalized instructions for this section are coming soon.

## Configure

Configure desired Minecraft server behavior.

### Operators

Allow specific players to moderate the server.

- Add desired moderators to `ops.json` list:

      "level": 4,
      "bypassesPlayerLimit": false
    }
  ]
  ```

### AllowList

Only allow listed players to connect to the server.

Prerequisite: [Operators](#operators)

Config:

Server Operators can manage the allowlist in game using the `/whitelist` sub
commands.
