Rust conventions, concepts, and best practices.

- Variables are immutable in Rust by default. Add `mut` before the variable name
  to make it mutable: `let mut number = 5;`
- Use `::` to call an associated function to a type: `... String::new();`
- Use `&` to pass by reference: `&var`. References are also immutable by
  default. Make them mutable: `&mut var`
- Statically typed
  - Scalar Types - Data types that represent singular values (integers,
    floating-points, booleans, characters)
  - Compound Types - Data types that represent value groups of multiple types
    (tuples, arrays)
- `snake_case` function and variable names
- Expressions are valid rust lines alone that do not end with semicolons
- Functions implicitly return the value of the last expression in the function
