# Stack

At the rate that new frameworks, technologies, and design patterns are created,
it is impossible and also nonsensical to maintain a static stack. However, in an
effort to create some semblance of consistency and prevent endless context
switching, I do tend to fallback on a common set of technologies for projects
that I maintain.

Generally speaking, I try to strike a balance between using the best tool for
the job, and using multi-purpose tools. That is to say, if the best tool for a
particular use case doesn't play well with the rest of my stack/knowledge base,
but the 2nd best tool does, I opt for the number 2 tool.

For this reason, you'll find that I try to choose tools that are applicable in
multiple domains.
