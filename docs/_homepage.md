## Principles

- Be consistent.
- Be inclusive.
- Be simple.
- Embrace open source.

## Overview

This is my personal software and dev process documentation. I have made it open
source to serve as an example to others. I do not claim to be an expert
on any of the covered topics, nor do I always follow industry best practices.
That is to say, **use this knowledge base at your own risk**.

With that said, I regularly update this repo as I discover better tools and
techniques. Since I *am* constantly trying to learn, feel free to create
issues or submit PRs **only** if you have something cool to share me, knowing
that I may choose to reject them. Otherwise, please fork and make adjustments
for your own purposes.
