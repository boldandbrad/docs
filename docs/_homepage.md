> Opinionated technical guides and docs.

## Principles

- Be consistent.
- Be inclusive.
- Be simple.
- Embrace open source.

## Overview

This repo hosts my personal technical documentation. I have made it open source
to serve as an example for others. I do not claim to be an expert on any of the
covered topics, nor do I always follow industry best practices.
**Use this knowledge base at your own risk**.

With that said, I regularly update this repo as I discover better tools and
techniques. Since I *am* constantly trying to learn, feel free to create
issues or submit PRs **only** if you have something cool to share with me,
knowing that I may choose to reject them. Otherwise, please fork and make
adjustments for your own purposes.
