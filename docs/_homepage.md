## Overview

Some things are documented well, but most are not. Many of the best solutions,
guidelines, and practices are buried deep in community forums and blog
posts. Too often, developers find themselves in a constant loop of Google,
Bookmark, Lose bookmark, Repeat.

This repo and corresponding site serve as an opinionated centralized store of
frequently sought after guides and solutions. Many of these guides are intended
to provide new developers the ability to quickly close to loop on common
concepts, processes, and tools.
