## Branches

Create a new branch from the main branch for each independent feature or fix.

### Naming

- Main - `main`
- Feature - `feat/<issue>/<desc>` / `f/<issue>/<desc>`
- Bugfix - `bug/<issue>/<desc>` / `b/<issue>/<desc>`

## Commits

Commit early and often. Squash commits.

### Amend Commit Message

Amend last commit message:

```zsh
git commit --amend -m "new message"
```

Safely force push new commit message to remote:

```zsh
git push --force-with-lease origin HEAD
```

## Tags

### Rename Tag

> Note: This can have consequences when collaborating on a repo. Use caution.

Create the new tag name from the old one and push it:

```zsh
git tag new_tag old_tag
git push --tags
```

If the old tag was associated with a GitHub release, update the release to point
to the new tag name.

Delete the old tag from both the remote and local:

```zsh
git push origin :refs/tags/old_tag
git tag -d old_tag
```
